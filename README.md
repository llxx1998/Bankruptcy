# Machine-Learning-Bankruptcy

This is a full-credit midterm project for Machine Learning course, which attempts to use machine learning algorithms to predict corporates' probability of defaults. 

The project is in ``Bankruptcy_oya.ipynb``. This notebook calls ``Model_functions.py`` for machine learning related functions and ``Supporting_functions.py`` for other functions. 

``MyModel.ipynb`` is the final model with the best performance. 

Welcome any insights.
